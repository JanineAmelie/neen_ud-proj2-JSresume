###Project-Overview

The resume was built using functions. The data, stored into four JS objects for each section of the page,   is dynamically inserted into reusable html snippets which are then appended into the page.  The result is a 'template' like webpage that change its content dynamically because its data has not been hardcoded into the index.html.
